# A Broad Review of ML Topics
This repository will be used to help me consolidate my knowledge regarding various ML topics.

This repository will include: 
* Notes on various topics (Edit: Note that markdown on Github isn't formatting the same as my local IDE, PyCharm, which may cause readability issues!)
  * Classical (Non-DL) ML/Statistics
    * Linear Algebra and Calculus
    * Probability and Information Theory
    * Statistical Learning Theory
    * Statistical Testing and Metrics
    * Bayesian Statistics
    * Linear Regression & Regularization
    * Naive Bayes & Logistic Regression & GLMs
    * SVMs
    * Decision Trees
    * Ensemble Learning, Random Forests and Boosting
    * Dimensionality Reduction
    * K-means
    * Gaussian Mixtures and EM
    * Gaussian Process
    * Causal Inference
  * DL (Note that the delineation is not super clear here and this separation is purely made for organizational purposes)
    * Basics
    * Activation Functions
    * Initialization
    * Optimization and Regularization
    * Coding Practices
    * CNNs
    * RNNs & LSTMs
    * Attention & Transformers
    * Autoencoders
    * Diffusion Models
    * Normalizing Flows
    * Generative Adversarial Networks
    * Graph Neural Networks
    * Meta-Learning
    * Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning
    * Optimization
    * Computer Vision
    * Natural Language Processing
      * Text Processing
      * LLMs From Scratch
      * Pre-training
      * Fine-tuning
    * Recommender Systems
    * Reinforcement Learning
    * Hyperparameter Optimization
    * Computational Performance
      * JAX + Flax
    * AI Safety
    * Applied Apps
      * RAG?
    * Misc
* Code implementation for various algorithms, which will mostly come from online resources/tutorials. 
  * The first priority would be to get implementations that work.
  * If time permits, a stretch goal would be to refactor the code with a greater emphasis on OOP, e.g. [John's repo](https://github.com/johnma2006/candle/tree/main)
  * I want to emphasize that the goal of these implementations would be to ensure that I have a thorough understanding of topics, rather than being the most involved projects. Notebooks may be more sparse if I believe my understanding to be sufficient. To that effect, notebooks for the classical ML topics will largely be calling scikit-learn libraries (from-scratch implementations of algorithms like SVMs, AdaBoost and K-means can be found in my other repos). 
* Interview Preparation

I shall try to be diligent in citing my sources. Due to visa-related time constraints, I do apologize for any lapses in citation. At the current moment, I envision pulling most heavily from the following sources:
